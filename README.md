# 🌼 Iris Flower Classifier

Welcome to my beginner-friendly machine learning project! This repository contains a complete workflow for classifying iris flower species using petal and sepal measurements. With just a few lines of code and powerful ML tools, we can teach a model to distinguish between **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**.

## 📌 Project Summary

The Iris dataset is often considered the "hello world" of machine learning — simple, clean, and perfect for understanding how classification models work. In this project, I used a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the species of an iris flower given four key measurements.

This task gave me hands-on experience with:
- Preprocessing real-world tabular data
- Encoding categorical labels
- Training and evaluating a classification model
- Visualizing performance using a **confusion matrix**

## 📂 Dataset Details

The dataset (`Iris.csv`) includes 150 flower samples with the following columns:
- 🌸 `SepalLengthCm`
- 🌸 `SepalWidthCm`
- 🌸 `PetalLengthCm`
- 🌸 `PetalWidthCm`
- 🏷️ `Species` (target class)

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – model building & evaluation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization
